**AI Research Assistant:** A modular, production-ready framework designed to streamline research workflows using advanced 
1) LLMs
2) vector databases
3)  web search integrations. 

**Overview**
AI Research Assistant Code leverages state-of-the-art language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Mistral) and **robust retrieval-augmented generation 
(RAG) pipelines**. 
It includes following process: 
1) parse content
2) store embeddings
3) Query documents with high accuracy and efficiency, making it ideal for both research 
and industry applications. 

**Architecture & Key Components Agent-Based Orchestration:** Built on LangGraph, the framework uses a flexible agent-based architecture for dynamic 
state management and node-based workflow orchestration. 

**Document Ingestion & Storage:** Supports seamless PDF ingestion, automatic chunking, and embedding storage in Supabase vector databases
for scalable, performant retrieval. Web Search Integration: Integrated tools (Tavily, Exa) provide fallback mechanisms, ensuring 
comprehensive information access beyond local data. 

**Security & Observability Secure Configuration:** Utilizes Pydantic and dotenv for robust, environment-agnostic configuration management. 
Enterprise-Grade Monitoring: Opik integration delivers built-in observability, supporting monitoring and traceability for production deployments. 

**Extensibility & Industry Relevance Modular Design:** Easily extendable with new tools, models, or data sources, supporting rapid 
adaptation to evolving research and business needs. 

**Reliability & Scalability:** Designed for real-world use cases where explainability, reliability, and scalability are critical.
